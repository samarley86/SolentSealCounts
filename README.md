# SolentSealCounts

This repository is supplementary to the manuscript "Increasing numbers of harbour seals and grey seals in the Solent", which has been submitted to *Biology Letters*.

Project Summary: This study utilised a 20-year dataset of seal counts from two neighbouring harbours in the Solent region of southeast England. Generalised additive models (GAMs) showed a significant increase in the numbers of harbour and grey seals utilising Chichester Harbour. Conversely, in Langstone Harbour there has been a significant decrease in the number of harbour seals.
