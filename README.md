# SolentSealCounts

This repository is supplementary to the manuscript *"Increasing numbers of harbour seals and grey seals in the Solent"*, which has been submitted for publication.

Project Summary: This study utilised a 20-year dataset of seal counts from two neighbouring harbours in the Solent region of southeast England. Generalised additive models (GAMs) showed a significant increase in the numbers of harbour and grey seals utilising Chichester Harbour. Conversely, in Langstone Harbour there has been a significant decrease in the number of harbour seals.

Contents:
- *AllSealCounts.csv* contains counts of harbour and grey seals collected during visual surveys in Chichester and Langstone Harbours, UK
- *SolentSeals* presents the data exploration and analysis, with an extended example of applying GAMs to harbour seal counts in Chichester Harbour. This can be viewed as either an .html or .pdf file.
- *Solent Seal Catalogue 2020* is a photo-ID catalogue containing images of all individually-identified harbour and grey seals from Chichester Harbour
